      <h1>What is Verba?</h1>

      <p>Verba is an AI-powered public speaking confidence trainer designed to support students in mastering one of the most essential skills of the 21st century: effective verbal communication. Whether it's a classroom presentation, a university interview, a debate competition, or simply learning to express ideas with clarity and confidence — Verba offers a structured, judgment-free, and self-paced environment for growth. <br/>

        Public speaking anxiety, or glossophobia, affects a significant percentage of students globally, often leading to missed academic opportunities and long-term confidence issues. While existing solutions like public speaking clubs, coaching classes, and mentorship programs exist, they are often inaccessible, unaffordable, or not suited to the unique needs of students — especially those in remote, under-resourced areas. <br/>

        Verba addresses this gap through a smart, accessible platform that allows users to record or upload their speeches, receive immediate AI-generated feedback on key performance indicators (such as pace, tone, filler word usage, and clarity), and track their progress over time. It is not just a feedback tool, but a complete speech improvement companion tailored specifically for the learning patterns, anxieties, and goals of students. <br/>

        Built with inclusivity, accessibility, and long-term impact in mind, Verba promotes self-paced learning and fosters a growth mindset in users. It also aligns with global educational goals by helping students build strong communication skills — a critical asset for academic success, employability, and leadership.

        In a world where your voice matters more than ever, Verba helps students find it, refine it, and use it with confidence.</p>
